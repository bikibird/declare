Speech Synthesizer for PICO-8.

## Notes
### Vowels
- The frequency of the first formant is mostly determined by the height of the tongue body:
   - high F1 = low vowel (i.e., high frequency F1 = low tongue body)
   -low F1 = high vowel (i.e., low frequency F1 = high tongue body)
- The frequency of the second formant is mostly determined by the frontness/backness of the tongue body:
  - high F2 = front vowel
  - low F2 = back vowel
